This is a simple landing page created as part of [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The primary goal of this project is to practice and master the use of Flexbox to create responsive layouts. The page is built entirely with HTML and CSS. Through this project, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of how to use flexbox to create flexible and adaptive layouts that can work across multiple devices and screen sizes.
# Design
